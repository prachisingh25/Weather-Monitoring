# Weather Monitoring Application

This Weather Monitoring Application fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for selected cities. It displays weather information, calculates daily temperature summaries, triggers alerts for specific temperature thresholds, and provides a visual representation of the weather trends.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays current weather data for multiple cities.
- **Custom City Search**: Add any city to monitor its weather.
- **Daily Summaries**: Calculates daily average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.
- **Temperature Alerts**: Notifies when the temperature exceeds a set threshold or falls below 0Â°C.
- **Chart Visualization**: Provides a graphical summary of the temperature trends.
- **Download Weather Report**: Download a JSON report containing weather data, daily summaries, and triggered alerts.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors in chart rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install, build, and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Weather-Monitoring

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd weather-monitoring-app

4. **Set Up API Key**

   You will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. If you don't have one, you can sign up for an account and     generate an API key here.
   Once you have the API key, replace YOUR_API_KEY in the Weather.js file with your actual API key:
    ```bash
    const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
